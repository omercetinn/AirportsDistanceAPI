# AirportsDistanceAPI

The distance between this project and airports is calculated in miles. This is an API project. 
A distance calculation was made based on the information received by sending a request to the https://places-dev.cteleport.com/airports/AMS link.

.Net Core 6.0 was used for this project.


The project was created according to the layered architecture. 
In the later stages of the project, it was designed with Onion Architecture by considering the relationship with a possible database.
